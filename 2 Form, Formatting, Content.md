##Big Picture
* Decisions of technology have political implications* Also, according to Heidegger – it changes the way you think* Extension of brain and hands “at the tips of your fingers” “ready at hand”* Extension of your memory is in your computer, calendar, pad* Production of knowledge is not so abstract
	* Pathway from brain, to finger, to computer to other computer etc.	* Can be visualized	* Text is often thought of as fixed points.	* Think of it as a vector traveling through space and time	* Continuously shifting, moving, morphing

##Vectors* Email has a vector	* Gmail -----------→	* Want email to be encrypted		* Email encrypted ----------- <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--------------→</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------------<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;↑     * Term Paper has a particular vector	* Paper -----------→* Email is indexed by index servers* Buying books from Amazon	* E-book ---------→* Research Paper: Mapping out all of the textual information that surrounds us	* Will probably find great disparity and entanglement of vectors
##Universality Problem* Solution: take origin points of all of the vectors (email, phone, ipad, amazon etc which all have a common set of problems: search, access, distribution, back up)* Problem: seeding control to ecosystems like google which would totalize vectors, but would maintain control.* The computer is a universal machine (The Turing paper: universal machine)* A computer can emulate any machine – level of abstraction that floats above the hardware* Evan Moghlin: lawyer, advocate for owning the hardware.* Can’t search different ecosystems at one time.* Must keep everything in plaintext rather than in proprietary formats.* Dream: Unify vectors in some format – long lasting and easy to vector-ize (send, convert etc)* Plain text is the most malleable (allows more political decisions rather than have a vectored decision)
	* Some people say it enables forms of politics (Bitcoin)	* Weapons and encryption is military (freedom can also be very political)	* Spur in computer science in post war – people who were working in communications were used towards war efforts	* Password protected pdf – competent hackers, adobe, and you and the person you send it too have the password – so is it totally encrypted?	* Plaintext enables encryption	* Depends on  who you want to reach and how?	* PDF is not malleable and should be taken into consideration.

##Form and Content* What you see is what you get (bold, italic etc)	* Underneath there is markup (From ---- to {make bold})	* Word processor and Printer flattens form and content* Interesting effect: The writer performs the job of a typesetter	* Gets stripped out by publisher and a prof. typesetter reformats work (outsourced)	* Smart thing to do: **separate content from the formatting**	* Concentrate on formatting later	* However: I need to understand content using form – hence the bold	* Acculturated habit? – real impact on cognitive ability?
##HTML* .doc → to .docx* Microsoft tried to move to XML* XML fell out of favor eventually* XML is similar to Aristotelian philosophy * Paragraph is semantic – can be formatted in many different ways	* Let the browser or CSS style sheet figure out how to format it* Difference Form (Symantec- logical unit), Content, and Formatting (Style - **B**, *I*, U)* Gunky* Markdown solves 2 problems	* To create a language that is truly human readable	* To create Aristotelian language??????
