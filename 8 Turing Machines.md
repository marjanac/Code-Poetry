<h1>Turing Machines</h1>

##Turing Machines vs. Universal Turing Machines* Takes symbol and negates it	* Machine 1: A --|> !A 	* Machine 2: A --|U A* Universal turing machines can take on the property of any other turing machine	* Machine that rewrites itself?	* Rewrites it’s own hardware##Explanation through Paper* Paper: Important in cognitive science	* How the mind works?	* Thought experiments* We may compare a man in the process of computing a real number to ;i machine which is only capable of a finite number of conditions q1: q2. .... qI; which will be called " m-configurations ". The machine is supplied with a "tape " (the analogue of paper) running through it, and divided into sections (called "squares") each capable of bearing a "symbol".	* Machine is aware.	* Configuration: determines the possible behavior of the machine* Universal Turing Machine comes later* Reconfigure it’s internal state##Program and Software* Does not rhetorically use the terms program and software* What would be considered the software?	* “The behaviour of the computer at any moment is determined by the symbols which he is observing, and his " state of mind " at that moment. We may suppose that there is a bound B to the number of symbols or squares which the computer can observe at one moment. If he wishes to observe more, he must use successive observations. We will also suppose that the number of states of mind which need be taken into account is finite.”##Run1.	cd Desktop/2.	mkdir WeaselTyping3.	cd WeaselTyping4.	cp File1.txt WeaselTyping/5.	nano WeaselWords.txt <br>a.	indicate <br>b.	reveal <br>c.	show <br>d.	dictates <br>e.	arguably <br>f.	considerably <br>g.	allegedly <br>h.	obviously <br>i.	claim <br>j.	evident <br>6.
